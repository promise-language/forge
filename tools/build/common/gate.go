// The gates this project provides.
//
// A gate MEASURES and never modifies what it measures. That is the whole
// difference between this file and verify.go: `verify` formats the tree with
// `gofmt -w` on its way to an answer, which is correct for a command and
// disqualifying for a gate — an answer about a tree that was repaired first is
// not an answer about the tree anyone proposed.
//
// A gate also does not JUDGE. Nothing here compares a number to a threshold or
// returns a verdict; it reports what it found and stops. Whether
// `unformatted_files: 3` is acceptable needs thresholds the gate deliberately
// does not hold — see run.go, and docs/gates-and-commands.md.
//
// Nothing in here writes to stdout. Stdout carries the envelope and nothing
// else, so every child process has its stdout captured. A child's stderr is
// passed through to the process's own stderr, where a person watching a long
// run can see progress as it happens — except in gateValue, where the caller
// needs to parse stderr separately.
